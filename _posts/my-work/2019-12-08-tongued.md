Making Tongued was a huge challenge. We were a [6 person team](#the-team), and had only 6 weeks to make it. The result is undoubtedly the **best** game I've worked on to this day. If you only play one of my games, make it this one.

It was inspired by Tom Francis' [Floating Point](https://store.steampowered.com/app/302380/Floating_Point/). Pablo and I asked ourselves what a competitive multiplayer version of that movement might look like, and Tongued was our answer.

## What did I do in it?
- I designed and programmed the core movement mechanics.
- I wrote much of the [networked gameplay code](#how-did-we-make-the-networked-gameplay).
- As the Lead Programmer, I made and communicated architectural decisions to the other 2 programmers in [the team](#the-team).
- I wrote the animation & HUD code.
- I made most of the SFX with my mouth.

## How did we make the networked gameplay?
We used [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/) (and its Unity integration, [PUN](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/PUN)) to handle the matchmaking and the communication layer between players.

We followed a strict workflow for the development of the gameplay: all features were first implemented for **local** play. Once the feature worked in one machine, we made an "Online" child class, overriding the relevant methods to add networked messages and syncing to the existing functionality.

This allowed us to implement mechanics without the mental overhead of networking, and then solving networking as a separate problem.

## The team
This game was made by [Fresisuis Hunters](https://twitter.com/FresisuisHunt), composed of the following people:
- **Pablo Velilla** - Game Designer, 2D Artist, Sound Designer

- **Carmen Gómez** - 2D Artist, UI Designer
- **César Romero** - Programmer
- **Jorge López** - Programmer
- **Aitor Iribar** - Lead Programmer, Game Designer, Sound Designer
