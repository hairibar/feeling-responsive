## Hi!
As you might have read already, I'm **Aitor Iribar**, a generalist game programmer. What I mean by that, is I like to dabble in everything. I've worked on online multiplayer, audio, animation physics, tools, shaders... I even was a musician for 10 years! I like knowing a bit about a lot of things, and then taking the occasional deep dive into a specific area.

I'm currently writing my thesis for my degree in Videogame Design and Development at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid). I'm also the lead programmer on a currently unannounced project with some classmates, which I'll hopefully be able to talk more about soon. 
Finally, I'm actively looking for a job making games!

As a programmer, my favourite part of the job is enabling my interdisciplinary teammates' visions, making those visions come true in their best possible form. This can mean building streamlined tools for a level designer, working with an animator to make a dynamic animation system, or working with an artist to make their art look the best it can.
        
Of course, I've got my own ideas as well! Design is one of those areas I've deep dived into, having served as a designer in most of the games I've worked on. I specially like to focus on making interactions that feel good, which is to say I enjoy using <strong>way</strong> too much screen shake.
        
Most of my experience is in **Unity,** though I've dipped my feet into Phaser, GameMaker and even pygame. 
In terms of code, I focus on making everything I write reusable, building a library of ready-made components so that designs can be expressed at a higher level. I also always keep architecture in mind, making sure these components are as self-contained as possible to avoid problems down the line.
