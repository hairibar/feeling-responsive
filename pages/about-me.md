## Hi!
I'm **Aitor Iribar**, a generalist game programmer. I like to dabble in everything. I've worked on online multiplayer, audio, animation physics, tools, shaders... I even was a musician for 10 years! I like knowing a bit about a lot of things, and then taking the occasional deep dive into a specific area.

I have a degree in Videogame Design and Development at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid). I'm also the lead programmer on [Tale of Jade](https://twitter.com/KEStudio_es), which I need to get around to writing about one of this days. Finally, I'm actively looking for a job making games!

As a programmer, my favourite part of the job is working with teammates from different disciplines to realise their vision.
                
Most of my experience is in **Unity,** though I've dipped my feet into Phaser, GameMaker and even pygame.
